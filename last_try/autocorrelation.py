        Global Moran's I provides a measure of the entire dataset ranging from -1 to 1, 
        where -1 indicates dispersion and 1 indicates full clustering. 
        To understand how this is reflected spatially at each station, 
        a local Moran's analysis was applied, categorizing the data 
        into stations based on the values of their surrounding stations.

            1. High values surrounded by high values (HH)
            2. High values surrounded by low values (HL)

            4. Low values surrounded by low values (LL)
            5. Cells with no significance

        Values of LH and HL indicate spatial outliers, while values of HH and LL indicate clusters.
